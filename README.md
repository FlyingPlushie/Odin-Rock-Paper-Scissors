# The Odin Project: Rock Paper Scissors Assignment

The Odin Project "Rock Paper Scissors" assignment in HTML, CSS &amp; JS done for practice by yours truly. You can view the [live version here.](https://flyingplushie.github.io/odin-rock-paper-scissors/index.html)

I've used [Obelix Pro](https://fontmeme.com/fonts/obelix-pro-font/), [Skrapbook](https://www.dafont.com/skrapbook.font), [Komika Axis](https://www.dafont.com/komika-axis.font), [Candy Shop](https://www.dafont.com/candy-shop.font) and [Aha-Wow](https://www.dafont.com/a-aha-wow.font) fonts. [Buttons](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_buttons.asp) are from the W3Schools. The rest of the work (HTML, CSS & JS) is mine.

JS is fairly simple and nicely demonstrates basic DOM usage.

CSS works for desktop and mobile (portrait).
